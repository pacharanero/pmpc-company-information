#### FSFE and PMPC
> We offer our thanks and acknowledgement to the [Free Software Foundation Europe](https://publiccode.eu/) and their Public Money Public Code campaign, which is closely aligned to PMPC's goals. We would like to make clear that PMPC CIC seeks to support, encourage, and synergise with existing campaigns such as FSFE, and we have also spoken to the FSFE to obtain their assent prior to using the PMPC phrase for this organisation

## Companies House
https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/08266350

The directorship of the CIC is limited to just 4 individuals for practical purposes, but this directorship is only for business administration purposes. Decisions regarding the operation and strategy of PMPC rest with the larger Executive Board.

### History
Public Money Public Code CIC was originally openGPSoC CIC ("open GP Systems Of Choice"), founded by Ewan Davis, Rob Dyke and Marcus Baw in 2012 for the purpose of developing an open-source GP system. Later it was renamed openhealthhub CIC in order to expand the scope of the project beyond just General Practice. Open Health Hub operated the openhealthhub.org public forum for discussion of health technology, under the direction of Marcus Baw. Since setting up a CIC takes time, and openhealthhub CIC was doing nothing very exciting, when Public Money Public Code needed a legal entity to get set up quickly, we rapidly re-purposed openhealthhub CIC for PMPC.
